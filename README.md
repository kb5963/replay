# Replay

A clean and simple PGN/PDN game replayer for the web.

This project provides standalone JavaScript applets to display and navigate game moves on a web page. It is designed to be fast and easy to embed. By hosting these resources here, we ensure that published games (HTML exports) remain functional and independent of the main Turbo Dambase website.

### Files
* **tcreplay.js**: The replayer logic for Chess (PGN).
* **tdreplay.js**: The replayer logic for Draughts (PDN).
